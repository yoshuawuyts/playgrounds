Hi I'm Yosh and I experiment. _"Hi Yosh"_. This is a little overview of my
experiments, for better or worse. Not all experiments are succesful, but that's
what they're for - to spike a certain idea or technology in an isolated
environment. It's worked out pretty well for me, perhaps it will too for you.

## Off to experiment land!
